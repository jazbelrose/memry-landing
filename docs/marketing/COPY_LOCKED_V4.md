## SECTION 1 — HERO

**Headline**
The shared brain teams use to plan, execute, and deliver work.

**Subhead**
memry brings decks, budgets, tasks, schedules, files, and communication into one
continuous system — so nothing breaks between intent and execution.

**Primary CTA** — Request Access
**Secondary CTA** — See How It Works

---

## SECTION 2 — THE PROBLEM

**Section Headline**
The system breaks when your work lives in five tools.

**Body Copy**
Plans in slides. Budgets in spreadsheets. Decisions in chat.
Tasks in Asana. Files in Drive.
Nothing connects — which means the project never actually stays aligned.
memry exists because production work is not a set of documents.
It's a single operational system.
Every change should ripple across the whole workflow instantly.

---

## SECTION 3 — THE SOLUTION

**Section Headline**
Everything moves together — because it's one workspace.

**Body Copy**
memry connects the pieces that normally drift apart:
Decks, budgets, tasks, calendars, files, approvals, and project communication.
When the budget changes, the task plan updates.
When a deck version ships, the team is aligned.
When spend hits the ledger, margin recalculates.
That's what "from planning to payment" actually means.
One system. Real-time. No tool-switching.

---

## SECTION 4 — SPELLBOOKS

**Section Headline**
Spellbooks generate real plans from real production inputs.

**Body Copy**
Use Spellbooks to translate a production scenario into structured outputs:
budget line items, task templates, schedules, staffing assumptions, and deliverables.
Instead of starting from scratch, you start from proven operating logic — and edit
from there.
This is how you scale repeatable work without repeating yourself.

**Feature List (Bullets)**
- Production-first templates (not generic AI)
- Output budgets + task maps instantly
- Designed for operators, not prompt engineers

---

## SECTION 5 — DECKS

**Section Headline**
Decks are version-controlled and built for client-facing work.

**Body Copy**
memry includes a multi-slide editor designed for concept decks, client previews,
and production-ready documentation.
No overwriting.
No "final_v7."
No misaligned versions between the designer, producer, and client.

**Feature List (Bullets)**
- Built-in slide editor (real-time)
- Create preview versions without risk
- Export to PDF anytime

---

## SECTION 6 — BUDGETS

**Section Headline**
Budgets stay connected to scope, margin, and reality.

**Support Line**
Structured line items. Real-time totals. Linked to tasks and delivery.

**Body Copy**
Budgets in memry aren't spreadsheets. They're a live model.
Cost, markup, and client price stay visible.
Line items link to tasks and deliverables.
As spend comes in, reconciliation updates margin — without manual cleanup.

**Feature List (Bullets)**
- Cost / markup / price model
- Task-linked line items
- Margin updates automatically

---

## SECTION 7 — TASKS

**Section Headline**
Tasks are assigned, tracked, and tied to real delivery.

**Support Line**
Not a list — a workflow.

**Body Copy**
memry tasks are structured by production logic:
assigned owners, status transitions, dependencies, and audit trails.
They connect directly to budget scope and project timelines — so tasks reflect
what the work actually costs and impacts.

**Feature List (Bullets)**
- Status workflow (with trails)
- Assignments + accountability
- Budget-linked execution

---

## SECTION 8 — FILES

**Section Headline**
Files, assets, and delivery live inside the project.

**Support Line**
Upload, organize, share, and deliver without losing context.

**Body Copy**
memry includes project file storage built for production environments:
team uploads, vendor files, client exports, revision sets, delivery links.
No more hunting through Drive folders or email attachments.
Everything is tied to the project and the work.

**Feature List (Bullets)**
- Structured file manager
- Client delivery links
- In-context attachments everywhere

---

## SECTION 9 — WHO IT'S FOR

**Section Headline**
Built for every role involved in real production.

**Subhead**
memry isn't a "tool for creatives."
It's an operating system for the full team.

**Bullet List**
- CEO / Admin: visibility across every project and dollar
- Producer / PM: real-time control of scope, schedule, approvals
- Design Lead / Creative Director: deck versioning, collaboration, delivery control
- Builder / Crew: clear tasks, files, and handoffs without chaos

---

## SECTION 10 — V1 READINESS

**Headline**
memry V1 is built for real teams running real budgets.

**Body Copy**
This is not a prototype.
V1 already supports decks, budgets, tasks, files, and project operations in one
connected workspace.
Access is currently limited while we onboard teams directly.
